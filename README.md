**Pokemon Marketplace**
Coded exclusively using Java and JavaFX
Create an Account, Login, and Bid on different Pokemon (Static)
Multiple accounts can bid in real time with background music and sound effects
Market Client was built as an Intellij Project 
Market Server was built in VSCode
Uploaded to Git for Visibility

Project Structure is VERY messy it was my first real fullstack project so there were a lot of design flaws.


Both JAR files should work (not a virus I promise) but it's all managed locally with information stored in a text file in the server.

MediaPlayer Dependency Bug in Market Client (have to set it up correctly within your intellij project for it to work)

Wrote it from scratch in 4 days and then moved on but it was a really fun project and my introduction to GUI's
